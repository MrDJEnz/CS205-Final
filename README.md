the game. 

Inside "run.py" you must set how many players or CPUs you wish to start the game with.
Then, running will bring you to a game menu to start

In game controls are as follows:
  'h key' = Help screen
  'n key' = Next round
  
  'Mouse right/left click' = Select/Unselect territory
  'Mouse up/down scroll' = Increase/Decrease selected troops

Usual game rules are followed. Players use troops and luck in order to
take over territories. Taking over continents grant troop bonuses each
round. To win, players must take over all the territories on the map.
